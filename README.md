# Asteroids
## Introduction
Build an Asteroids Game. We're going to build a simple video game, based on the classic [Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)). If you've never played before, you can take a look at this (slightly different from our) [version of the game](https://www.echalk.co.uk/amusements/Games/asteroidsClassic/ateroids.html).

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+ installed
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) project and package manager
- Access to a unix-like shell (e.g. zsh or bash)

## Why this project?
Because of learning goals such as:
- Multi-file Python projects
- Real-world use case for object-oriented programming
- Have fun building a program
Because this project is part of the [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) Backend development course.
